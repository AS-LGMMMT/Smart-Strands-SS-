ABOUT YOUR PROJECT

We as team are planning to make a smart salon system to cope up with a real time problem that everyone of us face while we go to a salon and automate the whole process. 
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
Nowadays, every salon is rushed with people and we have to wait for our turn. We know that time is precious and everyone works round the clock. So, nobody prefer to wait for hours and hours for their turn.
SOLUTION:
We have decided to make a project ‘SMART STRANDS’ to automate the appointment process for the salons. There would be a website with two types of login system, one for the owner of the salon and one for the customer. Additionally, the website will have only one time login option (either as a customer or as a customer). For the customer login page, the customer will be able to login to the site and there will be 3 options from which the user can choose.
OPTION 1: “PROFILE” in which user will have the choice to change or update the user information and logout button.
OPTION 2: “BOOK AN APPOINTMENT TODAY” in which the user will initially see a menu of services that he/she wishes to have and then get the QR code which will be scanned at the salon and the user will be given the vacant time for the appointment and a message notification in which the time of appointment will be specified.
OPTION 3: “MAKE RESERVATION” in which the user will have the option to choose the service and schedule the appointment for any date and time according to their wish with an option for advance payment.
For the owner login page, the owner will login into the site after entering the password and can access the information of all the services given in the day at the salon and all the reservations made by the customers.
